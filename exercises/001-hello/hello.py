# 
# Houston, we have a problem.
#
# During your first day at WizKidz Inc. you learn the software department is
# reeling from an automated refactor gone wrong performed by an AI it 
# has been developing.
#
# You are tasked with fixing the faulty programs.
#
# Problem:
# This program normally printed out "Hello World" but now it just does not compile!
#
# In Python, functions take any arguments type. 
#
# A commonly used type for printing out characters is the `string` type.
# A string in python is expressed by wrapping text in double quotes `"`. i.e: "hey there!"
#
# Try fixing the argument to the fmt.Println function and run `python hello.py`
# to see if it works.



def main():
	# Knowing about the string type, modify
	# the argument to print to be a single string.
	print(Hello World)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
